How to run this app,
This app requires XCode 12 and iOS 14.2 or hgiher. Clone this project, and then please download this machine learning model since it's too big to be uploaded on github: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13v58uJqi_pAXKoBa2J7mZ7sLkaSRVUBb/view.
Once you have the model downloaded, you will also need to install coreMl using pip, and run it in an virtual evn in python 2.7. Then please use the scripyt inside the flower classifacion model folder to transfer the downloaded ML model into .ML model. Once you have .ML model integrated inside the project, this app will be ready to run. We apologize for this complex process, we didn't anticipate this inconvenience when we were desiging the app!
